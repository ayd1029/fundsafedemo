# FundSafe - Anti-Rug Pull Solution
https://fundsafe.io


FundSafe is a solution for transparent management of project funds.

Often the project team embezzles funds or uses them somewhere unrelated to the project.
We present a new paradigm to solve these problems.


[ Workflow ]

1. Register the project in FundSafe for ICO / INO.

2. ICO / INO funds are deposited in FundSafe.

3. The project team registers a fund use plan.

4. DAO votes.

5.1 Requests for withdrawal of funds that have not been approved cannot be withdrawn.

5.2 Request for withdrawal of funds approved can be withdrawn by the amount requested amount.

◦ Projects that use FundSafe will be marked with certification.
◦ Users can check on the FundSafe website to see if the project actually uses FundSafe.

※ Projects that have already been funded can also be managed by keeping funds in FundSafe.
